# CNPJ_Parser

A HTML document that receives user input and checks wether that input is in CNPJ valid format.
In this project, a valid CNPJ format is an input that follows one of the following formats:

. Format 1:

    00.000.000/0000-00 # eightteen digits

. Format 2:

    00000000000000 # fourteen digits

Where the character '0' can be replaced by any other digit.

## Build

Simply open the index.html file in your browser. Click on the html file with the right click of your mouse, select the "Open with another app" option and choose any of your browsers(preferably explorer, chrome or firefox) then select that option. If none of your browsers appear, the choose the "See all apps" option and search for one of your browsers.

## How to use

Insert your input in the box at the center of the HTML page and it'll print YES(very large and noticeable on your screen) if your input is in a valid CNPJ format or NO if it isn't.
